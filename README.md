# About Me

I am an accomplished IT strategist and leader with over two decades of experience in steering IT governance, strategy, and deployment. Renowned for designing resilient architecture frameworks, I excel in creating cutting-edge solutions for insurance carriers and diverse enterprises. As a seasoned Software Engineer, I specialize in developing sophisticated enterprise applications and managing global offshore teams. I have a proven track record of successful end-to-end implementations and strong relationship-building, effectively bridging development teams, business stakeholders, clients, and executive leadership. I love family just as much as I love coding. Believer. Father. Son. Husband. Uncle. These titles mean so much to me.
